<h1>TimeClocker 1.0</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to the Time Clocker! This little application will clock you in faster than you can say "Strengthen the foundation to stimulate growth."</p>
<h1>DO NOT close or interact with this Chrome Window!</h1>
<h2>How to use:</h2>
<h3>Enter your ExponentHR credentials into the command prompt that is open behind this window.</h3>
<p>Once the program logs you in, you will be clocked in mon-fri 9-5 for all weeks in the current pay period. Run this program at the beginning of each period.</p>
